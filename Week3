  <h3> Charlie </h3>

    <strong>Charlie</strong> is 4 years old. I got him when I was 18 and he was 4 months old.
    He's a very friendly cat and loves to socialize. He <em>loves</em> being brushed
    (probably because he has dandruff). Charlie is my nasty boy and he doesn't
    behave great but I put up with it because he's the best cuddler in town.

  <h3> Risu </h3>

    <strong>Risu</strong> is 2 years old. I got her when I was 19(?) and she was 4 months old.
    She's more shy than Charlie but she's still really sweet and friendly. She
    loves long cuddles and making me open the bathroom door when she stratches the bathroom
    door and then running away. She also <em>loves</em> running around and she sounds like
    a little horse when she does.

  <h3> Socks </h3>

    <strong>Socks</strong> is about 13 years old. My mom got Socks about three years ago when Socks
    was 10 years old. Socks is a sweet old lady who has high standards. She <em>loves</em>
    the finer things in life, like a good cat post with a great view, and a warm
    lap to lay on. She has some health problems so now she only eats wet food. She
    wakes my mom up every day at 5:30am to demand breakfast. She's the best old
    lady cat I know.
